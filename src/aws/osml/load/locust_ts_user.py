    """
    :class:`TileServerUser` is a class representing a user that interacts with a tile server. It inherits from
    `FastHttpUser` class provided by the `locust` library. The class provides methods for simulating user behavior on
    the tile server, such as creating, retrieving, and discarding viewpoints, as well as querying metadata, bounds,
    info, and statistics of existing viewpoints.

    Examples:
        Creating an instance of :class:`TileServerUser` and running a load test with Locust:

        .. code-block:: python

            from locust import User, TaskSet, constant, HttpUser, between
            from tile.server.user import TileServerUser

                tasks = [TileServerUser]
                wait_time = between(1, 2)

    To run the locust file:
    $res locust -f filename.py with python 3.8.5 and above; for old versions of python we may use locustio instead of locust
    :class:`TileServerUser` provides the following instance variables:
        - `test_images_bucket`: The S3 bucket name for test images.
        - `test_images_prefix`: The prefix for filtering test images within the S3 bucket.
        - `test_image_keys`: The list of test image keys in the S3 bucket.
        - `wait_time`: The time interval (in seconds) between each task execution.
